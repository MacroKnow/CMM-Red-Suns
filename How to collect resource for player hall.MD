In the [Basic Build Team Suggestion](https://github.com/ZeroIme/cmm-red-suns/blob/master/Basic%20Build%20Team%20Suggestion.MD) I mainly explan how important Player Hall is.

In this essay. I will talk about how to collect those resource.

1. Game Money ![GameMoney](mediaResource/game-money.png)

    Use scout to get player card, and sell the useless card. I seems have no good idea to collect it. Sell the useless card seems the fast way. But I never sell A card unless I evolve it once. A card will help finish letter event(get s card, and sell it).

2. Yellow blocks ![GameMoney](mediaResource/yellow-blocks.png)

    As we all know it only produce in World Tournament. It it obvious that use gems to negotiation, so we have only 10 times to negotiation. I suggest to negotiate to 'Finbury Pub'. It is easy to negotiation for twince.  But 'Finbury Pub' won't give you green stones.

3. Green Stones ![GameMoney](mediaResource/green-stones.png)

    Green Stones is hard to get it. It only produce upper 'Finbury Pub'. And it is very easy to be robbed. there is a bad way to get it. But I think it is the most economical way. You need prepare 2 ~ 5 account which is over lv.40(min level for World Tournament),  you can guard your small account to get green stone. And also you can rob others. It is a bad way to get green stone, but effective.

4. Gems ![GameMoney](mediaResource/gems.png)

    Gems, emmmmmmmmm........... top up or not it is a choice. monthly card seems is a good top up options. But if you can't get more, please save it. There are many place thirst for gems.
