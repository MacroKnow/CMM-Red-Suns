Since 'The Player Hall' feature updated. This game realy change a lot, Player Hall can add a lot attribute for same country player. In the past you can use multinational coalition, but now they force us use one national players.   Because enhance a single country Player Hall is already very difficulty. We don't have enough resource to support multinational.

My torres's Hall is lv.18 , ss skill + 1. lv.18 Hall is a basic line for ss card , I call it Hall +1.

how many resource did I cost for torres? 

I cost me about 676M money, 13.6K yellow blocks,180 green stone and 7900 gems. A country Hall have 8 players, Spanish Hall +8. Total need 5B money, 108.8K yellow blocks,1440 green stone and 63.2K gems.

That's why I suggest use one national players.

let me show you some a case who use single spanish country player hall.
